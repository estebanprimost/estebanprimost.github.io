# Esteban Primost

I’m Esteban, a Computer Systems Engineer with 15+ years of experience building and scaling software products. In recent years, I’ve worked as a Senior JavaScript Engineer and Team Lead, specializing in Node.js and React, and collaborating closely with product, design, and engineering teams.

I’m particularly interested in **Product Engineer**, **Founding Engineer**, or **Full Stack Engineer** roles, where I can take ownership across the stack and contribute to shaping products from early ideas to real-world impact.

Let’s build great products.

### [Alliants](https://alliants.com)
**2023 – 2025**

I contributed to the development of a platform for creating surveys focused on young students. I worked across the stack, moving between **backend engineering** and **frontend development** depending on the needs of the product and the team.

This work helped **reduce friction in key user flows**, improve platform responsiveness, and surface structural improvements that had a measurable impact on the quality and stability of the product. The outcomes —both in terms of impact and learning— were highly positive.
